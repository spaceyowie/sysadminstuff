[[ How to configure DNS reverse lookup with Pi-Hole and EdgeRouter PRO 8 ]]


[1] In ER8, add a domain name to the router and each DHCP server, then enable hosts file updates by the DHCP server service:
	
	$ set system domain-name {domain.name}
	$ set service dhcp-server shared-network-name {DHCP server name} subnet {DHCP subnet} domain-name {sub.domain.name}
	$ set service dhcp-server hostfile-update enable

NOTE: The DHCP server domain names may be subdomains of the domain name specified on the ER8.

[2] In ER8, modify the firewall rules to allow DNS traffic from Pi-Hole to Local.	
[3] In Pi-Hole, navigate to Settings > DNS > Advanced DNS Settings and configure:

	- "Never forward non-FQDNs" = disabled
	- "Never forward reverse lookups for private IP ranges" = disabled
	- "Use Conditional Forwarding" = enabled
		> "IP of your router" = ER8's IP
		> "Local domain name" = {domain.name}

[4] Save Pi-Hole settings and restart the DNS service.
[5] Done.
