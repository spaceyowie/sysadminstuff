[[ How to make a bootable USB on macOS ]]


Machine: Macbook Pro (2018)
OS: macOS Catalina 10.15.x, Big Sur 11.0.x

Goal: To create a bootable USB drive from an OS ISO file.
ISO: Windows Server 2016 Standard, ESX Hypervisor 6.7, FreeNAS 11.3


Works:
----------------
[1] balenaEtcher : as a non-admin user, Etcher needs elevated permissions (user added to sudoers).
[2] Rufus (Windows) : create a Windows VM in VMware Fusion or VBox, ensure the USB is set to MBR and not GPT.


Didn't Work:
----------------
[1] diskutil (CLI) : convert .iso to .img.dmg, rename to .img, write with dd
[2] DiskUtility (GUI)
[3] Unetbootin
