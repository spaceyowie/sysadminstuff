[[ Miscellaneous LibreNMS issues (and maybe fixes) ]]


[Problem 1] Enabling Applications for discovered hosts generates "Problem with backend" error.
[Fix] There is no reverse DNS in the environment, all servers are referred to by IP.
Open the browser dev tools and click on the toggle button for the Application. If the message says "Cross-Origin Request Blocked: The Same Origin Policy disallows reading the remote resource at http://vlsv-nim1/ajax_form.php." then the issue is LibreNMS referring to its server by hostname and not IP.
In LibreNMS, click the cog icon > Global Settings > System > Server > and modify the "LibreNMS hostname" and/or "Specific URL" to specify localhost and not the hostname.



[Problem 2] During installation, LibreNMS complains about --no-dev option


[Problem 3] Pi-hole snap extend script is not discovered by LibreNMS.
[Fix] Check that the SNMPd user can execute the pi-hole script:

	$ sudo -u Debian-snmp /etc/snmp/pi-hole

Test SNMP has been configured correctly:
	
	$ snmpwalk -v2c -c {publicstring} localhost .1.3.6.1.4.1.8072.1.3.2.3.1

If snmpwalk's output is "No more variables left in this MIB View (It is past the end of the MIB tree)", check that snmpd.conf does not contain "-V systemonly" parameter:

	rocommunity {publicstring} default
